Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters. Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located. The format of Lisa's book is as follows:

- There are **n** chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from **1** to **n**.
- The ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i^{th}) chapter has **arr[i]** problems, numbered from **1** to **arr[i]**.
- Each page can hold up to **k** problems. Only a chapter's last page of exercises may contain fewer than **k** problems.
- Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
- The page number indexing starts at **1**.

<!-- more -->

Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?

For example, Lisa's workbook contains **arr[1] = 4** problems for chapter **1**, and **arr[2] = 2** problems for chapter **2**. Each page can hold **k = 3** problems. The first page will hold **3** problems for chapter **1**. Problem **1** is on page **1**, so it is special. Page **2** contains only Chapter **1**, Problem **4**, so no special problem is on page **2**. Chapter **2** problems start on page **3** and there are **2** problems. Since there is no problem **3** on page **3**, there is no special problem on that page either. There is **1** special problem in her workbook.

**Note**: See the diagram in the Explanation section for more details.

## Function Description

Complete the workbook function in the editor below. It should return an integer that represents the number of special problems in the workbook.

workbook has the following parameter(s):

- n: an integer that denotes the number of chapters
- k: an integer that denotes the maximum number of problems per page
- arr: an array of integers that denote the number of problems in each chapter

<br/>

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers **n** and **k**, the number of chapters and the maximum number of problems per page. 
The second line contains **n** space-separated integers **arr[i]** where **arr[i]** denotes the number of problems in the ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i^{th}) chapter.


<br/>

## Constraints

- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1\leq&space;n,&space;k,&space;arr[i]\leq&space;100)

<br/>

## Output Format

Print the number of special problems in Lisa's workbook.

<br/>

## Sample Input
```
5 3  
4 2 6 1 10
```

<br/>

## Sample Output
```
4
```

<br/>

## Explanation

The diagram below depicts Lisa's workbook with **n = 5** chapters and a maximum of **k = 3** problems per page. Special problems are outlined in red, and page numbers are in yellow squares.

There are **4** special problems and thus we print the number **4** on a new line.

### Solution `Accepted`

```javascript
function workbook(n, k, arr) {
  let currentPage = 0;
  
  return arr.reduce((target, pages, index) => { 
    target += new Array(pages).fill(index).reduce((innerTarget, page, innerIndex) => { 
      ((innerIndex) % k === 0) && currentPage++;
      ((innerIndex + 1) === currentPage) && ++innerTarget;
      console.log(innerIndex + 1, innerTarget, currentPage);
      return innerTarget;
    }, 0);

    return target;
  }, 0)
}
```
