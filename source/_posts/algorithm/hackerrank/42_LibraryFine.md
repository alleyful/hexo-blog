Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: `fine = 0`.
2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, `fine = 15 Hackos x (the number of days late)`.
3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the `fine = 500 Hackos x (the number months late)`.
4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of `10000 Hackos`.

Charges are based only on the least precise measure of lateness. For example, whether a book is due January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017, if it is returned January 1, 2018, that is a year late and the fine would be `10000 Hackos`.

## Function Description

Complete the libraryFine function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the fine due.

libraryFine has the following parameter(s):

- d1, m1, y1: returned date day, month and year
- d2, m2, y2: due date day, month and year

<br/>

## Input Format

The first line contains **3** space-separated integers, **d1, m1, y1**, denoting the respective **day**, **month**, and **year** on which the book was returned. 
The second line contains **3** space-separated integers, **d2, m2, y2**, denoting the respective **day**, **month**, and **year** on which the book was due to be returned.

<br/>

## Constraints

- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1\leq&space;d1,&space;d2\leq&space;31)
- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1\leq&space;dm1,&space;m2\leq&space;12)
- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1\leq&space;dy1,&space;y2\leq&space;3000)
- **It is guaranteed that the dates will be valid Gregorian calendar dates.**

<br/>

## Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.

<br/>

## Sample Input
```
9 6 2015
6 6 2015
```

<br/>

## Sample Output
```
45
```

<br/>

## Explanation

Given the following dates: 
Returned: `d1 = 9, m1 = 6, y = 2015`
Due: `d2 = 6, m2 = 6, y = 2015`

Because ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y2&space;\equiv&space;y1), we know it is less than a year late. 
Because ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m2&space;\equiv&space;m1), we know it's less than a month late. 
Because ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?d2<&space;d1), we know that it was returned late (but still within the same month and year).

Per the library's fee structure, we know that our fine will be `15 Hackos x (# days late)`. We then print the result of `15 x (d2 - d1) = 15 x (9 - 6) = 45` as our output.

### Solution

```javascript
function libraryFine(d1, m1, y1, d2, m2, y2) {
  return y1 === y2
    ? (m1 === m2
      ? (d1 <= d2 ? 0 : (d1 - d2) * 15)
      : (m1 > m2 ? (m1 - m2) * 500 : 0))
    : (y1 < y2 ? 0 : 10000);
}
```
