An integer **d** is a divisor of an integer **n** if the remainder of **n / d = 0**.

Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

**Note**: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same digit should be counted (e.g. for **n = 111, 1** is a divisor of **111** each time it occurs so the answer is **3**).

## Function Description

Complete the findDigits function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of digits of **d** that are divisors of **d**.

findDigits has the following parameter(s):

- n: an integer to analyze

<br/>

## Input Format

The first line is an integer, **t**, indicating the number of test cases. 
The  subsequent lines each contain an integer, **n**.

<br/>

## Constraints

- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1\leq&space;t\leq&space;15)
- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0<&space;n<&space;10^{9})

<br/>

## Output Format

For every test case, count the number of digits in **n** that are divisors of **n**. Print each answer on a new line.

<br/>

## Sample Input
```
2
12
1012
```

<br/>

## Sample Output
```
2
3
```

<br/>

## Explanation

The number **12** is broken into two digits, **1** and **2**. When **12** is divided by either of those two digits, the remainder is **0** so they are both divisors.

The number **1012** is broken into four digits, **1**, **0**, **1**, and **2**. **1012** is evenly divisible by its digits **1**, **1**, and **2**, but it is not divisible by **0** as division by zero is undefined.

### Solution

```javascript
function findDigits(n) {
    return [...String(n)].reduce((target, number) => {
        (n % number === 0 && number !== 0) && ++target;
        return target;
    }, 0)
}
```
