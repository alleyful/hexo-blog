HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

- Every student receives a `grade` in the inclusive range from **0** to **100**.  
- Any `grade` less than **40** is a failing grade.  
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's `grade` according to these rules:  

<br/>
<!-- more -->

- If the difference between the `grade` and the next multiple of **5** is less than **3**, round **grade** up to the next multiple of **5**.
- If the value of **grade** is less than **38**, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example, `grade = 84` will be rounded to **85** but grade = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than **40**.

Given the initial value of **grade** for each of Sam's **n** students, write code to automate the rounding process.

## Function Description

Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below. It should return an integer array consisting of rounded grades.

gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

- grades: an array of integers representing grades before rounding

<br/>

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, **n**, the number of students. 
Each line **i** of the **n** subsequent lines contains a single integer, **grades[i]**, denoting student **i**'s grade.

## Constraints

- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1<&space;n\leq&space;60)  
- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0&space;\leq&space;grades[i]&space;\leq&space;100)


<br/>

## Output Format

For each **grades[i]**, print the rounded grade on a new line.

Student 1 received a 73, and the next multiple of 5 from 73 is 75. Since 75 - 73 < 3, the student's grade is rounded to 75.
Student 2 received a 67, and the next multiple of 5 from 67 is 70. Since 70 - 67 = 3, the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 67.
Student 3 received a 38, and the next multiple of 5 from 38 is 40. Since 40 - 38 < 3, the student's grade will be rounded to 40.
Student 4 received a grade below 38, so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 33.

### Solution

```javascript
function gradingStudents(grades) {
  return grades.reduce((target, grade) => {
    target.push(
      (grade > 37 && ((grade % 5) > 2))
        ? (Math.round(grade/5)*5)
        : grade
    );
    
    return target;
  }, [])
}
```
