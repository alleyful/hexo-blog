## Objective

Today, we're taking what we learned yesterday about Inheritance and extending it to Abstract Classes. Because this is a very specific Object-Oriented concept, submissions are limited to the few languages that use this construct. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task

Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:

- Inherits from Book
- Has a parameterized constructor taking these **3** parameters:
1. string **title**
2. string **author**
3. int **price**

- Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these **3** lines:

1. **title**, a space, and then the current instance's **title**.
2. **author**, a space, and then the current instance's **author**.
3. **price**, a space, and then the current instance's **price**.

**Note:** Because these classes are being written in the same file, you must not use an access modifier (e.g.: **public**) when declaring MyBook or your code will not execute.

<br/>

## Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The Solution class creates a Book object and calls the MyBook class constructor (passing it the necessary arguments). It then calls the display method on the Book object.

<br/>

## Output Format

The **void display()** method should print and label the respective **title**, **author**, and **price** of the MyBook object's instance (with each value on its own line) like so:

```
Title: $title
Author: $author
Price: $price
```

**Note:** The **$** is prepended to variable names to indicate they are placeholders for variables.

<br/>

## Sample Input

The following input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in your editor:

```
The Alchemist
Paulo Coelho
248
```

<br/>

## Sample Output

The following output is printed by your display() method:

```
Title: The Alchemist
Author: Paulo Coelho
Price: 248
```

### Solution

```javascript
class MyBook extends Book {

    /**   
    *   Class Constructor
    *   
    *   @param title The book's title.
    *   @param author The book's author.
    *   @param price The book's price.
    **/
    // Write your constructor here
    constructor(title, author, price) {
        super();

        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.price = price;
    }

    
    /**   
    *   Method Name: display
    *   
    *   Print the title, author, and price in the specified format.
    **/
    // Write your method here
    display() {
        console.log(`Title: ${this.title}`);
        console.log(`Author: ${this.author}`);
        console.log(`Price: ${this.price}`);
    }
    
// End class
}

```
