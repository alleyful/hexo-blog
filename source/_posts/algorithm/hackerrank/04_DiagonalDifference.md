Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
```

The left-to-right diagonal = **1 + 5 + 9 = 15**. The right to left diagonal = **3 + 5 + 9 = 17**. 
Their absolute difference is **|15 - 17| = 2**.

## Function description

Complete the **diagonalDifference** function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

- arr: an array of integers .

<br/>

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, **n**, the number of rows and columns in the matrix **arr**. 
Each of the next **n** lines describes a row, **arr[i]**, and consists of **n** space-separated integers **arr[i][j]**.

<br/>

## Constraints

- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?-100\leq&space;arr[i][j]\leq&space;100)

<br/>

## Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

<br/>

## Sample Input
```
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
```

<br/>

## Sample Output
```
15
```

<br/>

## Explanation

The primary diagonal is:
```
11
   5
     -12
```

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:
```
     4
   5
10
```

Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19 
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15


* Note: |x| is the absolute value of x

### Solution

```javascript
function diagonalDifference(arr) {
    // Write your code here
    return Math.abs(arr.reduce((target, item, index) => {
        let length = item.length - 1;
        return target + item[index] - item[length - index]
    }, 0));
}
```
