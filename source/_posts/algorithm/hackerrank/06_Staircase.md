Consider a staircase of size **n = 4**:
```
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```

Observe that its base and height are both equal to **n**, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints a staircase of size **n**.

### Solution

```javascript
function staircase(n) {
    let strings = Array(n).fill('#');

    return strings.reduceRight((target, string, index) => {
        target.push([...strings].join('').replace('#'.repeat(index), ' '.repeat(index)));

        return target
    }, []).join('\n');
}
```
