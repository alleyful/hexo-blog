Taum is planning to celebrate the birthday of his friend, Diksha. There are two types of gifts that Diksha wants from Taum: one is black and the other is white. To make her happy, Taum has to buy **b** black gifts and **w** white gifts.

- The cost of each black gift is **bc** units.
- The cost of every white gift is **wc** units.
- The cost of converting each black gift into white gift or vice versa is **z** units.

Help Taum by deducing the minimum amount he needs to spend on Diksha's gifts.

For example, if Taum wants to buy **b = 3** black gifts and **w = 5** white gifts at a cost of **bc = 3, wc = 4** and conversion cost **z = 1**, we see that he can buy a black gift for **3** and convert it to a white gift for **1**, making the total cost of each white gift **4**. That matches the cost of a white gift, so he can do that or just buy black gifts and white gifts. Either way, the overall cost is `3 * 3 + 5 * 4 = 29`.

## Function Description

Complete the function taumBday in the editor below. It should return the minimal cost of obtaining the desired gifts.

taumBday has the following parameter(s):

- b: the number of black gifts
- w: the number of white gifts
- bc: the cost of a black gift
- wc: the cost of a white gift
- z: the cost to convert one color gift to the other color

## Input Format

The first line will contain an integer **t**, the number of test cases.

The next **t** pairs of lines are as follows: 
- The first line contains the values of integers **b** and **w**. 
- The next line contains the values of integers **bc**, **wc**, and **z**.

## Constraints

- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1\leq&space;t\leq&space;10)
- ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0\leq&space;b,&space;w,&space;bc,&space;wc,&space;z\leq&space;10^{9})
 
<br/>

## Output Format

**t** lines, each containing an integer: the minimum amount of units Taum needs to spend on gifts.

<br/>

## Sample Input
```
5
10 10
1 1 1
5 9
2 3 4
3 6
9 1 1
7 7
4 2 1
3 3
1 9 2
```

<br/>

## Sample Output
```
20
37
12
35
12
```

<br/>

## Explanation

- **Test Case #01**:  
Since black gifts cost the same as white, there is no benefit to converting the gifts. Taum will have to buy each gift for 1 unit. The cost of buying all gifts will be:  
`b * bc + w * wc = 10 * 1 + 10 * 1 = 20`.


- **Test Case #02**:  
Again, we can't decrease the cost of black or white gifts by converting colors. **z** is too high. We will buy gifts at their original prices, so the cost of buying all gifts will be:  
`b * bc + w * wc = 5 * 2 + 9 * 3 = 10 + 27 = 37`.


- **Test Case #03**:  
Since **bc > wc + z**, we will buy `b + w = 3 + 6 = 9` white gifts at their original price of **1**. **b = 3** of the gifts must be black, and the cost per conversion, **z = 1**.   
Total cost is `9 * 1 + 3 * 1 = 12`.


- **Test Case #04**:  
Similarly, we will buy **w = 7** white gifts at their original price, **wc = 2**. For black gifts, we will first buy white ones and color them to black, so that their cost will be reduced to `wc + z = 2 + 1 = 3`. So cost of buying all gifts will be:   
`7 * 3 + 7 * 2 = 35`.


- **Test Case #05**:  
We will buy black gifts at their original price, **bc = 1**. For white gifts, we will first black gifts worth **bc = 1** unit and color them to white for **z = 2** units. The cost for white gifts is reduced to `wc = bc + z = 2 + 1 = 3` units. The cost of buying all gifts will be:    
`3 * 1 + 3 * 3 = 3 + 9 = 12`.

### Solution `Accepted`

```javascript
function taumBday(b, w, bc, wc, z) {
  const bigB = BigInt(b);
  const bigW = BigInt(w);
  const bigBc = BigInt(bc);
  const bigWc = BigInt(wc);
  const bigZ = BigInt(z);

  return bigBc > bigWc + bigZ
    ? (bigB * (bigWc + bigZ) + bigW * bigWc)
    : (bigWc > bigBc + bigZ
      ? (bigB * bigBc + bigW * (bigBc + bigZ))
      : (bigB * bigBc + bigW * bigWc));
}
```

<br/>

### Solution `Wrong Answer`

```javascript
function taumBday(b, w, bc, wc, z) {
  return Math.min((b + w) * wc + b * z, (b + w) * bc + w * z, b * bc + w * wc);
}
```

<br/>

### Solution `Wrong Answer`

```javascript
function taumBday(b, w, bc, wc, z) {
  return bc > wc + z
    ? ((b + w) * wc + b * z)
    : (wc > bc + z
      ? ((b + w) * bc + w * z)
      : (b * bc + w * wc));
}
```
